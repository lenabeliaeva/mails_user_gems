⚠️ Disclaimer
This project was completed within a limited time frame. As a result:

Tests (unit/integration) are not included.

Error handling is minimal or missing.

Controller level is not implemented

Some areas may lack robustness and best practices (e.g., input validation, edge case handling).

Despite the above, the code should provide a good representation of architectural thinking, Spring knowledge, and general Java backend development skills.

✅ Features Implemented

Service and repository layer with basic business logic

Integration with H2 database

Use of Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and other common dependencies

🛠️ Tech Stack
Java 17+

Spring Boot

Spring Data JPA

H2

Gradle

🚀 Getting Started
To run the project locally:

Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spring-test-task.git
cd spring-test-task

Build and run the application:

bash
./gradlew bootRun
The application should now be running on http://localhost:8080.

📌 Notes
The project is a functional prototype, not production-ready.

Given more time, I would focus on:

Adding comprehensive tests

Implementing centralized exception handling with proper HTTP response codes

Improving input validation

Refactoring for better modularity where needed

Implementation if controller layer
